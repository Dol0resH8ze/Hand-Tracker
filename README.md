# Hand Tracking and ASL Letter Recognition

## Description

This project uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect and track hands in real-time from your webcam.

Currently, it:

- Detects one or more hands in real-time
- Draws hand landmarks (21 key points per hand)
- Shows FPS on screen

Future updates can include **recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) letters** from hand gestures.

This project is ideal for:

- Learning computer vision basics
- Building gesture-controlled applications
- Experimenting with ASL recognition
